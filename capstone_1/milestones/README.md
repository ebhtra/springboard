### This directory contains reports submitted as sub-projects during completion of the main project. 

To someone reading the main Beer Recommender project report, the interesting item here is the <b>Data_Story.ipynb</b> notebook, which is linked to from that report, and which contains a lot of exploratory material left out of the main project.  Many of the data's features were discarded after exploring them here, including elements of time and location relating to the checkins.  Those 2 dimensions were interesting to explore, and as such they hopefully make for an interesting read here, but their predictive powers weren't useful to recommendations.
